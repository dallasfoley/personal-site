        Hi, I'm Dallas, a recent MSU graduate who studied Mathematics and
        Computer Science and now specializes in frontend web development. I
        enjoy building websites in React.js with TypeScript and prefer Tailwind
        as a styling solution for its flexibility and ease of customization. I
        am also very interested in the union of static site generation and
        server-side rendering and particularly how can enhance performance and
        search engine optimization and have hence been delving into Next.js. In
        my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, channeling creativity into
        songwriting. I also enjoy diving into the competitive world of League of
        Legends and spending quality time with my friends and cat, Piplup.
